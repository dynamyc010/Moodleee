# Moodleee (needing of a rebrand tbh)
 A Discord bot used for gathering your due assignments from Moodle to Discord.

## Currently it can:
- Register multiple users
- Gather your assingments
- Send you a reminder every 12 hours (currently at 6AM and 6PM, not configurable right now)
- Make you cry how bad the Moodle REST API is

## Planned:
- Gather assignments you missed (and haven't given in anything for)
- <s>Figure out what the hell most of the API does</s> I give up
- Warn user ~2 hours before the deadline. <s>Otherwise, send a DM every 12 hours. (Maybe at 6AM and 6PM?)</s> <i>This part's done.</i>
